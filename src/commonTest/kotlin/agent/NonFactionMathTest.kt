 * Tests for [NonFactionMath.opposingHalf] — the pure directional pick extracted from
 * `opposingOffscreenDestination` (PLAN non-functional track, phase B). It selects the off-map points whose
 * bearing from the centre most OPPOSES the NPC's, so NPCs walk clear across the field (the fix for the
 * round-field "everyone piles up north" bug) rather than to the nearest edge.
