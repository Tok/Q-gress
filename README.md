  * action preferences
  * tendency to randomly create long links
  * deployment skills
    * tendency to deploy to the opposite octant of existing max reso
- Display FPS

### Low Priority

### Third Party Copyrigths

- Ingress and the concept of Ingress are Copyright of Niantic, Inc. https://www.nianticlabs.com/
- Q-gress doesn't scrape any Data from Ingress and there is no intention to use real portal data.
- All simulated agents and portals are user-created or generated randomly
