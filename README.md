## Work in Progress

At this stage Q-Gress is more or less a playground. 
Depending on commit history, the version presented may be nightly snapshot not behaving correctly.
Q-Gress was never tested on Mobile and is exclusively designed for desktop browsers.

## TODO

### High Priority
- Implement shielding
- Improve agent behavior
  * More destinations
    * Move to next agent
    * Move to group of agents
    * Move to random agent
- Implement inventory limit

### Medium Priority
- Improve agent characteristics
  * action preferences
  * tendency to randomly create long links
  * deployment skills
    * tendency to deploy to the opposite octant of existing max reso
- Display FPS

### Low Priority
- Ultrastriking
- More Items
  * XM-Tanks
  * Quantum-Capsules

### Further Ideas
- Find a way to hook up a neural network for Q-learning
- Create a mode to that uses emojis for agent visualization

### Third Party Copyrigths

- Ingress and the concept of Ingress are Copyright of Niantic, Inc. https://www.nianticlabs.com/
- Q-gress doesn't scrape any Data from Ingress and there is no intention to use real portal data.
- All simulated agents and portals are user-created or generated randomly
